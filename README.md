### Rules

* Get to the end of the Level and defeat the bot tanks
* You will die if you lose all your health
* Each bullet hit will decrease your Health by 1
* Hitting an enemy unit will INSIANTLY KILL you


### Notes on mechanics

* Running soldiers will be difficult to see underwater. (Only their head is visible )
* Jump, Right and Dash for longer distance
* The bird powerup will trigger only if you are walking on a platform while activating.
* Hence jumping directly on top of the powerup will not activate as you are not on a platform. This can be
used to prevent unwanted drops to death
* Trying to drop when on water will cause you to drown and die !!
* Direction of shooting is determined by the mouse position. Mouse above/below the player shoots a bullet at an angle of +/- 45 degrees 
from the ground.
* RMB activates Dash when it is out of cooldown. Its cooldown is depicted in top center of the screen Use this ability to cross broken bridges for example.
* A random powerup drops in front of the player every 2 seconds. If it goes out of screen behind the player, it disappears
* Snipers shoot only when the player is infront of them
* Soldiers who run across the screen are generated randomly every 3 seconds in front of the player
* All global settings are present in the 'settings.py'. They can be changed by the player to make the game more interesting and/or challenging
